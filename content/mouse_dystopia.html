<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>John Calhoun</strong> built the colony at the National Institute of Mental Health in Maryland in 1968<ul>
<li>he grew up in Tennessee</li>
<li>he was tasked to determine what caused rodents (e.g. mice) overpopulate in cities<ul>
<li>this led to him setting up experiments with large rodent population</li>
<li>he also saw potential in extrapolating perfect rodent cities to perfect human cities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>it was a small 1,3x1,3x1,3m cube where the mice had everything they needed for survival<ul>
<li>plenty of food and water</li>
<li>a perfect climate</li>
<li>reams of paper to make cozy nests</li>
<li>256 separate apartments</li>
<li>mice were also screened for any disease</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>theoretically mice could live here to long age without any hinderences (i.e. the definition of heaven)</li>
<li>this was his most famous experment - 25th of the many</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>
<ul>
<li>month 0 - first mice are planted into the cube</li>
<li>month 3.5 - first pups are born<ul>
<li>→ population <strong>doubles</strong> every <strong>55 days</strong></li>
<li>growth started stagnating</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>month 19 - population peaks at 2 200 mice</li>
<li>month 21 - population starts to plummet and births stop</li>
<li>month 58 - utopia goes extinct</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h3>
<ul>
<li>wild infant mortality among mice is high contrasting with the remarkably low mortality in the utopia<ul>
<li>there were many more young mice than would be usual</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in rodent society some male mice would natually lose their alpha position in a fight <ul>
<li>in nature that would result in leaving for elsewhere</li>
<li>in utopian crowded place there was nowhere to leave for</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>→ those two factors combined led to huge numbers of &quot;dropouts&quot; who would regularily engage in huge fights<ul>
<li>those fights generally served no purpose as opposed to the ones forming the social hierarchy</li>
<li>occasionally dropouts turned into cannibalism</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>alpha males struggled as well because they had to constantly defend their position (and their living quarters)<ul>
<li>they grew exhausted and sometimes just quit defending</li>
<li>as a result nursing females (who would have otherwise been defended by the alphas) were regularily attacked together with their pups</li>
<li>many pups left their mothers in fear way too early as a consequence</li>
<li>sometimes mothers left the pups in a run for their own lifes away from the violence<ul>
<li>→ pups died of neglect</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mice who had troublesome childhood (see above) developed other deviant behaviour <ul>
<li>weak social bonds (due to social problems in early age)</li>
<li>maladjusted females began isolating themselves like hermits in empty apartments<ul>
<li>unusual behaviour for mice</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>maladjusted males took to grooming all day<ul>
<li>preening and licking themselves hour after hour</li>
<li>oddly enough they had no interest in opposite gender and sexual behaviour despite being &quot;beautiful&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>it was noticed that this maladjusted behaviour can prove contagious among mice<ul>
<li>dubbed the &quot;behavioral sink&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>later, births stopped and only older mice lingered abandoned in their quarters</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="human-parallels">Human parallels</h3>
<ul>
<li>19th and 20th centuries saw population booms across the world, largely due to drops in infant mortality<ul>
<li>similar to the experiment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>also though human birth rates have dropped sharply in many developed countries—often below replacement levels</li>
<li>young people in those places have reportedly lost interest in sex</li>
<li>back then behavioral biologists have echoed the eugenics movement in blaming the strange behaviors of the mice on a lack of natural selection<ul>
<li>lack of culling resulted in supposed “mutational meltdowns” that led to widespread mouse stupidity and aberrant behavior</li>
<li>essentially gene mutations caused by the lack of natural selection interfered with brain function because of its inherent sensitivity caused by being heavily defined by those said genes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in the modern day, women are supposedly falling into Calhoun’s behavioral sink by learning “maladaptive behaviors” <ul>
<li>such as choosing not to have children → “destroying their own genetic interests”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>other critics agonize over the supposed loss of traditional gender roles, leaving effete males and hyperaggressive females</li>
<li>it was also viewed at the time as a faulty welfare (socialist) system that removes all challenges from the human life</li>
<li>though the fall of Universe 25 might have been caused by other (in human terms solvable) problems<ul>
<li>above all wealth distribution</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h3>
<h4 id="dropping-birthrates">Dropping birthrates</h4>
<ul>
<li>appearance of the sexless “beautiful ones” does seem decadent and echoes the reported loss of interest in sex among young people in developed countries<ul>
<li>a closer look at the survey data indicates that such worries might be overblown</li>
<li>mouse rates dropped partly due to infant neglect and spikes in infant mortality—the opposite of the situation in the developed world</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="dropping-intelligence">Dropping intelligence</h4>
<ul>
<li>there are the warnings about the mutational meltdown and the decline of intelligence<ul>
<li>hermit females and preening, asexual males certainly acted oddly but they avoided the fights that beset earlier generations<ul>
<li>does not appear to prove the &quot;drop in intelligence&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>some of Calhoun’s research actually saw rodents getting smarter during experiments</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>it was used as a proof for eugenic claims<ul>
<li>see [[eugenics]]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>also sometimes technological breakthrough appeared<ul>
<li>instead of carrying dirt out bit by bit, they packed it all into a ball and rolled it out the tunnel in one trip<ul>
<li>compared to humankind inventing the wheel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>by normal rat standards, this was deviant behavior but also a creative breakthrough</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="status-and-isolation">Status and isolation</h3>
<ul>
<li>males who lost the fights for dominance couldn’t leave to start over elsewhere<ul>
<li>they were stuck in pathetic, humiliating roles and lacked a meaningful place in society</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>same went for females when they couldn’t nurse or raise pups properly</li>
<li>both groups became depressed and angry, and began lashing out<ul>
<li>because mice are social animals, they need meaningful social roles to feel fulfilled</li>
<li>same applies to humans</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>though this interpretation seems like a stretch<ul>
<li>humans have far more ways of finding meaning in life than pumping out children or dominating some little hierarchy</li>
<li>population density among humans doesn’t necessarily correlate with crowding—a feeling of psychological stress</li>
</ul>
</li>
